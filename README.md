## Installation

Requires Python 3.10 or higher.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/greenwh/aerthos.git
cd aerthos

# No additional dependencies needed - uses only Python standard library!
```

## How to Play

```bash
python main.py
```

### Basic Commands

- **Movement**: `go north`, `n`, `south`, `east`, `west`
- **Combat**: `attack orc`, `cast magic missile`
- **Items**: `take sword`, `equip longsword`, `use potion`, `drop torch`
- **Exploration**: `search`, `look`, `map`
- **Character**: `inventory`, `status`, `rest`
- **Game**: `save`, `help`, `quit`

### Tips for Survival

1. **Manage Your Light** - Torches burn out! Carry spares and watch for warnings.
2. **Rest When Safe** - Find safe rooms to restore HP and spells.
3. **Search Carefully** - Thieves can find and disarm traps; others might trigger them!
4. **Know Your Limits** - Combat is lethal. Retreat to safe rooms if wounded.
5. **Save Often** - Character death is permanent. Use save points wisely.

## The AD&D 1e Experience

This game recreates the feel of classic 1st Edition AD&D:

- **Lethal Combat** - Hit points are precious. A few bad rolls can end your adventure.
- **Resource Management** - Track light, food, and spell slots carefully.
- **Old School Challenge** - No hand-holding. Exploration and caution are rewarded.
- **Dice Control Your Fate** - Roll 3d6 in order for abilities. No re-rolls!

## Game Design

Aerthos follows these AD&D 1e principles:

- **THAC0**: Roll d20, hit if `roll >= (THAC0 - target AC)`
- **Saving Throws**: Roll d20, succeed if `roll <= save value`
- **Vancian Magic**: Memorize spells, cast once, restore on rest
- **Turn-Based Time**: 1 turn = 10 minutes, important for resource tracking
- **Side Initiative**: Whole party vs. monsters (d6 each side)

## Development Status

**Current Version**: 1.0 (MVP)

This is a pilot implementation with:
- ✅ Complete core systems
- ✅ Character creation
- ✅ Full THAC0 combat
